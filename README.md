I've been programming in R for several years now and absolutely love it!! However, I'm always looking to learn new skills and in my new role as a quantitative methodologist, understanding and programming in SQL is necessary in order to extract data from our data warehouse. 

I was excited when I came across this awesome 4-hour course by Luke Barousse: [SQL for Data Analytics - Learn SQL in 4 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA)

The last portion of the course involves using a dataset of real-world data science job postings from 2023. The instructor provides a Google Drive link to download the CSV and SQL files to load the dataset into my PostgreSQL database and he walks us through how to use Visual Studio Code (which happens to be my favorite text editor) and GitHub to complete the project and showcase all of the work!
